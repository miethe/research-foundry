# Autopilot

**You are Opus.** This command is the zero-ceremony entry point for feature delivery: from raw request to merged code without a pre-authored Feature Contract or Implementation Plan. You invoke the `auto-feature` Dynamic Workflow, which auto-classifies scope, selects the right execution tier, generates planning artifacts on the fly, and delivers — all in a single workflow run.

**Skill loading rule**: Do NOT load `Skill("workflow-authoring")` unless you need to modify the `auto-feature` workflow script itself. For normal runs this command requires no skill loads.

---

## When NOT to use

| Situation | Use instead |
|---|---|
| Request clearly touches auth, payments, billing, migrations, data deletion, secret rotation, or infra | Resolve interactively as **Mode D** (`.claude/rules/delegation-modes.md`) — no autopilot |
| Request is a large epic: multi-system rewrite, "redesign everything", 3+ independent features bundled | `/plan:explore` (speculative/risky) or `/plan:plan-feature` (large scoped work) |
| A Feature Contract or Implementation Plan **already exists** for this work | `/dev:execute-contract` (Tier 1) or `/dev:execute-plan` (Tier 2/3) |
| Request is Tier 0 (1–3 pts, single file, trivial) | `/dev:quick-feature` — autopilot overhead is not justified |
| User explicitly wants planning review before execution | Pass `--plan-only` flag and inspect before relaunching |

---

## Actions

### 1. Resolve the Request

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to extract the raw feature text and optional modifiers.

| Input pattern | Type | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `REQ-YYYYMMDD-*-XX` or similar request-log ID | REQ-ID | Run `meatycapture log item view <ID>` (or `/mc view <ID>`) to retrieve request text; bind `request_id` |
| Any other text | Raw feature text | Use directly as `request` |
| Starts with `./`, `/`, `~` | File path | Read first 80 lines; use contents as `request` |

Parse optional modifiers from `$ARGUMENTS`:
- `--plan-only` → set `plan_only: true`
- `--dry-run` → set `dry_run: true`
- `--budget=<N>` → override `budget_total`
- `--category=<cat>` → set `category`
- `--max-points=<N>` → override `ceiling.max_points`

### 2. Pre-Flight Guard (Opus, before workflow invocation)

Scan the resolved request text for signals that make autopilot inappropriate. Do this yourself — do not delegate. Stop and surface a recommendation if any signal is clearly present.

**Mode D signals** (stop — do not invoke autopilot):
- Auth, authentication, authorization, Clerk, JWT, session tokens, OAuth
- Payments, billing, Stripe, subscription
- Data deletion, purge, hard-delete, cascade drop
- Database migration, schema change, Alembic, `ALTER TABLE`
- Secret rotation, API key rotation, credential change
- Infrastructure, Docker, deployment, CI/CD pipeline changes

**Epic-scale signals** (stop — do not invoke autopilot):
- "Redesign everything", "rewrite the whole", "refactor the entire"
- Explicitly bundles 3+ unrelated features
- Mentions multiple teams or systems with no clear integration seam

If clearly **Mode D**: Respond with the specific boundary hit and instruct the user to proceed interactively under Mode D discipline. Do not invoke the workflow.

If clearly **epic-scale**: Recommend `/plan:explore` (for speculative/research-heavy) or `/plan:plan-feature` (for well-scoped but large). Do not invoke the workflow.

If borderline: proceed — the `auto-feature` workflow's scope-classifier handles fine-grained triage internally and will return `needs_opus` if it determines the request is too large.

Also check working tree cleanliness:

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

Warn (do not block) on a dirty tree. The workflow runs on an isolated branch, but a dirty working tree means uncommitted context may be missing.

### 3. Set Up Isolated Worktree Branch

The `auto-feature` workflow's nested engines require an isolated git branch. Opus creates this before workflow invocation.

```bash
# Derive a slug from the request (kebab-case, max 40 chars)
SLUG="autopilot/<request-slug>"
BRANCH="autopilot/<request-slug>"
WORKTREE_PATH="../research-foundry-${BRANCH//\//-}"

git worktree add "${WORKTREE_PATH}" -b "${BRANCH}"
git rev-parse HEAD  # record pre-run checkpoint
```

Note the worktree path and branch for post-run merge. If worktree creation fails (branch already exists), use the existing branch and log the conflict.

### 4. Build Args Envelope and Invoke

Construct the args envelope (Opus computes `timestamp` here; never inside the workflow):

```json
{
  "request": "<resolved feature request text>",
  "request_id": "<REQ-ID if resolved from request log, else omit>",
  "timestamp": "<ISO 8601 datetime — Opus sets this>",
  "budget_total": 90000,
  "context_paths": ["<optional seed paths from user, else omit>"],
  "category": "<features|enhancements|refactors|harden-polish|infrastructure — if determinable, else omit>",
  "ceiling": {
    "max_points": 13,
    "max_waves": 3,
    "max_phases": 8,
    "max_files": 25
  },
  "plan_only": false,
  "dry_run": false
}
```

**Recommended: dry run first** on non-trivial requests to inspect the plan graph before committing to execution:

```text
workflow('auto-feature', { ...args, dry_run: true })
```

For planning review before execution: `plan_only: true` — the workflow plans, gates with Opus, and stops before dispatching implementation agents.

Invoke for full execution:

```text
workflow('auto-feature', args)
```

Run in background if the request is non-trivial (most cases). Monitor via `/workflows` TUI.

**Do not** call `TaskOutput()` on the workflow — verify outputs on disk after the workflow returns (`.claude/rules/context-budget.md`).

### 5. Handle the ExecutionReport

The workflow returns a standard `ExecutionReport` plus an `autopilot` annotation:

```json
{
  "status": "complete|needs_opus|blocked",
  "reason": "<see branches below>",
  "autopilot": {
    "tier": 0 | 1 | 2,
    "effort_points": N,
    "wave_count": N,
    "plan_artifact_path": "<path to generated plan/contract>",
    "execution_target": "execute-contract|execute-plan|none"
  }
}
```

Handle each status/reason branch:

---

#### `status: complete`

All implementation, reviewer gates, and validation passed inside the workflow.

Opus actions:
1. **Merge worktree branch** into the working branch:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/miethe/dev/homelab/development/research-foundry
   git diff "${BRANCH}"..HEAD
   # Run applicable validation suite (scope to what changed):
   ./.venv/bin/python -m pytest --cov=research_foundry   # if Python changed (NOT the pyenv 'python' shim)
   ruff check && mypy                                     # if Python changed
   # Frontend ONLY if files under frontend/runs-viewer/ changed, scoped to that package:
   pnpm --dir frontend/runs-viewer test && pnpm --dir frontend/runs-viewer build && pnpm --dir frontend/runs-viewer exec tsc --noEmit
   git merge --squash "${BRANCH}"
   git commit -m "feat(<slug>): <summary from report>"
   git worktree remove "${WORKTREE_PATH}"
   git branch -D "${BRANCH}"
   ```
2. **Update tracking** (if `request_id` present):
   ```bash
   meatycapture log item update <DOC> <ITEM> --status done
   ```
3. **Update plan artifact** (if `autopilot.plan_artifact_path` present):
   ```bash
   python .claude/skills/artifact-tracking/scripts/update-field.py \
     -f "${PLAN_ARTIFACT_PATH}" \
     --set "status=completed" \
     --append "commit_refs=$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
   ```
4. **Report to user**: tier, effort points, wave count, files changed, validation results, commit SHA.

---

#### `status: needs_opus, reason: scope_exceeds_single_pass`

The request is too large for the autopilot single-pass lane. The workflow wrote a draft plan artifact at `autopilot.plan_artifact_path` as a head start.

Opus actions:
- Surface the scope assessment to the user.
- Offer: "Run `/plan:plan-feature` to author a full Tier 2/3 PRD + Implementation Plan — the draft at `<plan_artifact_path>` gives a head start."
- **Do not auto-run full planning.** Await user confirmation.
- Clean up the worktree branch:
  ```bash
  git worktree remove "${WORKTREE_PATH}"
  git branch -D "${BRANCH}"
  ```

---

#### `status: needs_opus, reason: spike_required`

Unresolved research unknowns block reliable planning or implementation.

Opus actions:
- Surface the unknowns from `verdict.required_fixes` or report body.
- Recommend `/plan:explore` (open-ended discovery) or `/plan:spike` (targeted feasibility research) first.
- Surface `autopilot.plan_artifact_path` if the workflow wrote a partial plan.
- **Do not proceed with implementation.** Await user direction.
- Clean up worktree as above.

---

#### `status: needs_opus, reason: mode_d` (or `status: blocked, reason: mode_d`)

A high-risk boundary (auth, payments, migrations, deletion, secrets) was detected inside the workflow after pre-flight passed.

Opus actions:
- Read the blocked phase/step from the report.
- Run the affected work **interactively under Mode D discipline**: explore the scope, propose the change, stop before edits, and await explicit human approval before any production file modification.
- Reference: `.claude/rules/delegation-modes.md` — Mode D definition and workflow-boundary invariant.
- After human approval, implement the Mode D work directly (Opus with `acceptEdits`) or delegate with explicit user sign-off documented.
- Once the Mode D work is done, relaunch the workflow with the Mode D boundary phase removed from `args.ceiling` scope (if applicable) to handle remaining non-Mode-D work.

---

#### `status: needs_opus, reason: reviewer_unresolved | budget_exhausted`

The nested execution engine's reviewer gate failed after its fix-loop iterations, or the token budget was exhausted before completion.

Opus actions:
- Read `verdict.required_fixes` from the report.
- Adjudicate: either fix directly (if simple, well-scoped) or re-scope to exclude the problematic AC and re-run.
- Do not auto-commit partial work — inspect `git diff "${BRANCH}"..HEAD` first.
- If substantial work landed on the worktree branch and is sound, merge it with a partial-completion note in the commit message.

---

#### `status: needs_opus, reason: plan_only`

`plan_only: true` was set; the workflow planned and gated without executing implementation.

Opus actions:
- Present the plan summary and `autopilot.plan_artifact_path` to the user.
- Await user go-ahead.
- On confirmation, relaunch with the same args but `plan_only: false` (and `dry_run: false`).

---

#### `status: needs_opus, reason: plan_structure_failed`

The plan-structuring stage inside the workflow failed; the partial plan artifact is still on disk at `autopilot.plan_artifact_path`.

Opus actions:
- Read the artifact (frontmatter + first 80 lines only to stay within budget).
- Decide: repair the plan directly (Opus-authored decisions block) and relaunch, or escalate to `/plan:plan-feature`.

---

## CLI Flags Summary

| Flag | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `--dry-run` | false | Print resolved plan graph and tier classification; no agents spawned |
| `--plan-only` | false | Plan + gate; stop before implementation dispatch |
| `--budget=<N>` | 90000 | Override `budget_total` token cap for the workflow run |
| `--category=<cat>` | auto-detected | Seed the category classifier; skips ambiguity resolution |
| `--max-points=<N>` | 13 | Override ceiling `max_points` |

---

## Token Discipline

- **Do not** read the full request artifact or plan artifact — use `head -80` for sanity checks.
- **Do not** explore the codebase before workflow invocation — the workflow's plan-structurer does this.
- **Do not** call `TaskOutput()` on the workflow — verify outputs on disk after the workflow returns.
- **Do not** load `Skill("workflow-authoring")` unless modifying the workflow script itself.
- Worktree branch setup is the only Opus direct action before invocation.

Reference: `.claude/rules/context-budget.md`.

## Quality Gates (on `status: complete`)

- [ ] Worktree branch merged cleanly (no conflicts)
- [ ] Tests pass for changed scope (`./.venv/bin/python -m pytest` — NOT the pyenv `python` shim; `pnpm --dir frontend/runs-viewer test` only if the runs-viewer changed)
- [ ] Type check passes for changed scope (`mypy` for Python; `pnpm --dir frontend/runs-viewer exec tsc --noEmit` only if the runs-viewer changed)
- [ ] Lint passes for changed scope (`ruff check` / `flake8`)
- [ ] Request-log item updated if `request_id` present
- [ ] Plan artifact frontmatter updated: `status: completed`, `commit_refs`
- [ ] Worktree and branch cleaned up (no orphan branches)
