/**
 * execute-contract — Tier 1 sprint workflow
 *
 * Spec: .claude/specs/workflows/execute-contract-workflow-spec.md
 * Master contract: .claude/specs/workflows/workflow-authoring-spec.md
 *
 * Patterns used: reviewerGate, fixLoop, modeBoundary (inline), two-stage structuring
 * Schemas: execution-graph.schema.json (args), execution-report.schema.json (return)
 *
 * Durability design (see workflow-authoring-spec.md §16):
 *   - Sprint stage: feature-sprint-executor, NO schema. Commits checkpoints to worktree.
 *     Writes Completion Report to a deterministic path before returning plain text.
 *   - Structure stage: haiku general-purpose agent, schema: SPRINT_RESULT_SCHEMA.
 *     Reads the report from disk and derives structured fields from git state.
 *   This two-stage design prevents a terminal StructuredOutput miss from discarding
 *   the sprint's committed work. The structure stage falls back gracefully on failure.
 *
 * P3 offload wiring (provider_routing_enabled=true required to activate):
 *   - AC validation reviewer: codex-executor (read-only sandbox, two-stage)
 *     Stage A: codex validates sprint ACs → writes checklist artifact (no schema).
 *     Stage B: cheap haiku structurer reads artifact → emits VERDICT_SCHEMA result.
 *     Stage-B miss: fallback verdict (approved:false) — Stage A artifact preserved.
 * P4 offload wiring (provider_routing_enabled=true AND args.fix_provider:'bob' required):
 *   - Fix-cycle agent: bob-delegate-executor when fix_provider:'bob' + Mode-D guard passes.
 *     Mode-D guard fires BEFORE Bob dispatch; on trigger → route to claude (on-primary).
 *     Bob fallback: timeout/binary-absent/structuring-error → log actual_provider_used:'claude',
 *     fallback_applied:true; dispatch same task to feature-sprint-executor immediately (no retry).
 *   MUST-stay (never offloaded under any flag):
 *   - Sprint executor: feature-sprint-executor (on-primary)
 *   - Fix agent (Mode-D or flag-off): feature-sprint-executor (on-primary; Mode-D boundary always active)
 *   - Mode-D boundary: fires before sprint spawns (constraint 2)
 *
 * Phase 1 Tier A nesting pilot (subtask_sharding_enabled, DEFAULT FALSE):
 *   When true, the on-primary sprint executor MAY shard bounded mechanical sub-tasks
 *   (test-writer, doc-updater, fixture-builder) to depth-1 nested helpers — mitigating the
 *   execute-contract-blows-context-on-large-files failure mode. Governed inline: depth=1,
 *   <25 tool uses/helper, single-committer (helpers never commit), Mode-D-at-depth bubble-up to
 *   a Completion Report blocker. Pilot-gated, never auto-promoted. See
 *   .claude/plans/subagent-nesting-orchestration-strategy-v1.md §6 Phase 1.
 *
 * Branch-placement contract (args.run_branch / args.branch_base / args.parent_branch):
 *   Workflow agents run in the SESSION's cwd on whatever branch that tree is checked out to. There
 *   is no per-agent cwd argument. They DO follow the session into a worktree it has ENTERED via the
 *   EnterWorktree tool (measured on Claude Code 2.1.224, 2026-08-07, and again on 2.1.226 — a
 *   lone 2.1.226 non-inheritance report did NOT reproduce, node_01KZGQE6GVJTGXRSHA57FYKNDQ,
 *   and the verdict is deliberately NOT cached: verify placement with the run's probe, never
 *   with a recorded measurement); what they cannot reach is a
 *   worktree merely CREATED with `git worktree add` while the session cwd stayed put — then they
 *   commit to the session branch regardless. Observed 2026-08-05 (run wf_944c5c91-78e):
 *   autopilot created `.claude/worktrees/<slug>` on `autopilot/<slug>`, that branch received ZERO
 *   commits, and both real commits landed on `main` — one of them pushed — skipping the PR,
 *   review, and squash gates silently while the report read `status: complete`.
 *   The fix is not a path argument; it is to name the branch the orchestrator expects and refuse
 *   to work anywhere else. That holds in BOTH lanes — the branch name is what this guard checks,
 *   and it is equally valid inside an entered worktree as in the session repo:
 *     - run_branch    the branch the session repo MUST be on. When set, a pre-sprint guard
 *                     verifies it and returns blocked/wrong_branch BEFORE any agent can commit.
 *     - branch_base   the pre-run checkpoint SHA. Replaces the `HEAD~10` guess in the structurer,
 *                     which silently computed files_touched against an arbitrary base.
 *     - parent_branch the PR base, carried through so the report can flag a mid-run parent move.
 *   All three are optional: unset ⇒ every guard degrades to its previous behaviour, so callers
 *   that have not been updated are unaffected.
 *
 * Four-constraints checklist:
 *   [x] No FS/shell access in script body
 *   [x] Mode D triggers early return before sprint spawns
 *   [x] All reviewer agents use edit-less agentType
 *   [x] No Date.now() / Math.random() / new Date() in script body
 *   [x] meta is a pure literal object
 *   [x] phase() titles match meta.phases exactly
 *   [x] Budget guard in fix-loop: budget.remaining() > 60_000
 *   [x] All implementation prompts include durability commit instruction

SUB-TASK SHARDING (Tier A nesting pilot — depth-capped, single committer):
To avoid a context blow on large files, you MAY shard bounded, mechanical sub-tasks to nested
helper agents via the Agent tool (e.g. test-writer, doc-updater, fixture-builder). Rules:
  - Depth cap = 1: helpers MUST NOT spawn their own children. Do not grant them recursion rights.
  - Each helper is bounded (keep its slice small, fewer than 25 tool uses) and scoped to the
    explicit file paths you name in its prompt.
  - SINGLE COMMITTER: helpers run in your worktree but MUST NOT git add/commit/push/stash. After a
    helper returns, review its output and commit it yourself as one of your logical units. This
    keeps your commit history the sole durable record.
  - Mode-D-at-depth: if a sub-slice would touch auth / payments / migrations / deletion /
    force-push / secret-rotation, do NOT delegate it and do NOT implement it — STOP and record it
    as a blocker in your Completion Report for Opus to handle. (This contract is gated non-Mode-D;
    this is defense-in-depth.)
  - Durability contract: a nested subtree is, from the workflow's view, part of your single
    agent() call — if a helper blows its context the whole sprint re-runs. Keep helper slices small
    and commit consolidated output promptly so progress survives.
Use sharding for independent mechanical slices only; keep the core implementation yourself.`

Sprint's SELF-REPORTED AC verdicts — these are the claims you are checking, not findings.
A sprint has marked ACs met while shipping a conceptual bug behind exactly this claim:
${acVerdicts || '(none reported by sprint)'}

Validate every Acceptance Criterion in the Feature Contract against the CODE, independently of
the verdicts above. Reach your own conclusion first, then note any AC where you and the sprint
disagree — that disagreement is a finding in its own right.

  MB=$(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)   # pin the base once; never diff origin/main..HEAD
  git diff "$MB"..HEAD

EVIDENCE RULE: evidence is a \`file:line\` you read or a behaviour you traced. A restatement of
the sprint's own verdict is NOT evidence — it validates the report against itself. If you cannot
point at code for an AC, it is NOT MET.

IMPORTANT — TWO-STAGE DURABILITY:
Write your complete AC validation checklist to: ${artifactPath}
Use this format per AC item:
  - [ ] AC text — NOT MET: reason
  - [x] AC text — MET: evidence (file:line or traced behaviour)

This file MUST exist before you return. A downstream structurer will read it to emit the verdict.
Do NOT emit structured output yourself. Do NOT git add/commit/push/stash.`
