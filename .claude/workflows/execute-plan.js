// HITL detection — tasks assigned to a human (not a registered agentType) are

// e.g. "nick"). They are collected as HITL gates and bubbled up to Opus after the
// wave's agent work completes (reason:'hitl_required'). Until the external task
// tracker (intent-tree) is wired in, this is the human-in-the-loop gate. A task is
// HITL when explicitly flagged (t.hitl === true) or its assigned_to is not a known agent.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// This set MUST mirror .claude/agents/ in THIS repo, plus the 'general-purpose' builtin — and
// nothing else. Deliberately not ~/.claude/agents/: a workflow that could only dispatch an agent
// present on one machine would pass here and fail on the node. Drift is bidirectional and
// both directions silently corrupt a run:
//   - a name listed here with NO agent file  → dispatched to nothing, agent() returns null,
//     and the task is silently dropped from the wave (it looks like it ran).
//   - a real agent missing from here         → isHitlTask() reclassifies it as a HUMAN gate,
//     so a perfectly dispatchable task never runs.
// Both had occurred in agentic_meta_dev: 4 phantoms (api-librarian, telemetry-auditor,
// frontend-developer, council-review) alongside 17 real agents omitted. Its copy was repaired
// against its own agents dir (05c5384); tests/test_workflow_agent_roster.py fails that repo's
// build if it drifts again.
//
// ⚠️ THE SET BELOW IS THE UPSTREAM DEFAULT AND HAS NOT HAD THAT REPAIR. It is the pre-repair
// legacy value, and it is what every deployment inherits until that deployment regenerates it.
// `api-librarian`, `telemetry-auditor` and `frontend-developer` are still listed here and exist
// in no known agents dir — a task assigned to one is dispatched to nothing and silently dropped
// from the wave. They are left in place rather than removed because presence is per-deployment
// and cannot be verified from upstream; removing a name that a given deployment DOES have would
// reclassify a dispatchable task as a human gate. Regenerate this set from the deploying repo's
// own .claude/agents/ — do not assume the default is correct for you.
//
// `council-review` is deliberately EXCLUDED: it is a skill, not an agent, in every deployment.
// Its presence here was the mechanism of a real defect — a phase whose only security signal was
// gate_lens:['security'] dispatched it as an agentType, so the security lens never ran while the
// failure looked like a flaky reviewer. Keeping it in this set is what let that pass isHitlTask()
// instead of being caught. Never re-add it.

// `p.batches[][]` used to be consumed as if every member were a COMPLETE task object,
// while /dev:execute-plan's pre-flight instruction ("group tasks by files_affected
// disjointness") reads naturally as an INDEX over `p.tasks`. Nothing reconciled the two and
// nothing rejected the mismatch, so an id-only member — `batches: [[{id:'M1-01'}]]` — took
// the worst possible path: `t.prompt` was undefined, so the agent was dispatched with the
// literal string "undefined" plus the durability footer; `t.assigned_to` was undefined, so
// `agentType` was undefined; and `isHitlTask({id})` returned FALSE (no `hitl` flag, and the
// unknown-agent branch is guarded by `!!t.assigned_to`), so the malformed member was
// classified DISPATCHABLE rather than caught. The wave then "ran", the agents burned budget
// on a one-word prompt, and their output flowed into taskOut and on to the reviewer gate,
// which was asked to validate acceptance criteria against work that was never attempted.
// No error, no null, no escalation — the phase could plausibly come back approved.

// loop — so an unresolvable member halts the run instead of spawning anything. Resolution is

// a static batch: the batch runs via parallel() and, unless the task carries
// isolation:'worktree', all its members share ONE working tree, ONE index and ONE HEAD.
// Observed live 2026-08-04 (7-task batch): a pathspec-less `git commit` swept a sibling's
// staged files into the wrong commit, and the follow-up `git reset --soft HEAD~1` to split
// them raced a third sibling's commit — a history rewrite under 6 concurrent writers,
// averted only by that agent's own caution. Attribution is the load-bearing loss: per-task
// commit_sha feeds the reviewer gate and the progress file's commit_refs, and under a shared
// index which files land in which commit is decided by scheduling.
//
// Two changes make the instruction survivable: (1) commits are pathspec-scoped and every
// history-rewriting verb is forbidden outright, so a racing sibling cannot be captured or
// clobbered; (2) the "branch you own" claim is made ONLY when isolation is real, so a
// shared-tree agent is told plainly that siblings are writing to the same branch right now.
//
// This also reconciles a doctrine conflict the footer previously lost: dev-execution/SKILL.md
// and git-worktree-pr-protocol.md both say the phase-owner is the SINGLE committer and that
// children "never git add/commit/push/stash". That rule still holds for NESTED children
// (see buildPhaseOwnerNestingClause). A batch task agent is not a nested child: it commits,
// but only its own assigned files, and never rewrites.

  - Depth cap = 1: children MUST NOT spawn their own children. Do not grant them recursion rights.
  - Each child is bounded to fewer than 40 tool uses (per-level context budget). Keep slices narrow.
  - Children may edit files in this worktree but MUST NOT git add/commit/push/stash. YOU remain the
    SINGLE committer for this phase and consolidate all child work into your commits.
  - Mode-D-at-depth: nested agents are PROHIBITED from auth / payments / migrations / deletion /
    force-push / secret-rotation work. If a sub-task touches Mode-D territory, do NOT delegate it to
    a child — STOP that thread and surface 'needs_opus / mode_d' in your Completion Report for Opus.

// partial, or self-reportedly under-evidenced — and that case was collapsing into a clean
// pass. Observed 2026-08-04 at an M1 council gate: the council's own scorecard said
// recommendation "proceed_with_conditions", overall 45/100, every lens 2–3/10, evidence
// completeness 1/10, and its findings.yaml recorded that 5 of 8 adjudicated findings never
// reached the artifact writer. The orchestrator received `approved:true` with
// `required_fixes: []` and `arc_validate_passed:false`, and the wave advanced. Nothing in the
// envelope pointed at any of it; it was found only by opening the scorecard by hand.
//
// Three independent losses, all pointing the same way — toward false assurance:
//   1. 'proceed_with_conditions' → approved:true. The verdict is boolean, so "proceed, but
//      these conditions hold" is indistinguishable from an unconditional pass, and the
//      conditions are dropped rather than carried as required_fixes.
//   2. Findings lost between adjudication and the artifact writer are reported as if the
//      SURVIVORS were the whole population — the envelope actively asserts watchlist:0 for a
//      run that had 3 watchlist findings it simply never received.
//   3. arc_validate_passed:false is present, load-bearing, and keyed off by nothing.
//
// A lost-findings or failed-validation run is NOT a rejection: there is no finding to act on,
// so a fix cycle would edit blind and then re-review unchanged code. It belongs in the same
// family as gate_ran:false — re-dispatch or record an explicit operator override. A
// conditional verdict IS actionable, so its conditions become required_fixes and it takes the
// normal non-approval path.
