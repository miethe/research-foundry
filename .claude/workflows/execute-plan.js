// Gate-tiering v4.1: `gate_lens` wins over `review_intensity`. The plan-optimizer

// authorization bypass twice. Reading gate_lens here is what makes the ruleset's

// HITL detection — tasks assigned to a human (not a registered agentType) are
// never dispatched via agent() (that would try to spawn an agent literally named
// e.g. "nick"). They are collected as HITL gates and bubbled up to Opus after the
// wave's agent work completes (reason:'hitl_required'). Until the external task
// tracker (intent-tree) is wired in, this is the human-in-the-loop gate. A task is
// HITL when explicitly flagged (t.hitl === true) or its assigned_to is not a known agent.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// This set MUST mirror .claude/agents/ in THIS repo, plus the 'general-purpose' builtin — and
// nothing else. Deliberately not ~/.claude/agents/: a workflow that could only dispatch an agent
// present on one machine would pass here and fail on the node. Drift is bidirectional and
// both directions silently corrupt a run:
//   - a name listed here with NO agent file  → dispatched to nothing, agent() returns null,
//     and the task is silently dropped from the wave (it looks like it ran).
//   - a real agent missing from here         → isHitlTask() reclassifies it as a HUMAN gate,
//     so a perfectly dispatchable task never runs.
// Both had occurred in agentic_meta_dev: 4 phantoms (api-librarian, telemetry-auditor,
// frontend-developer, council-review) alongside 17 real agents omitted. Its copy was repaired
// against its own agents dir (05c5384); tests/test_workflow_agent_roster.py fails that repo's
// build if it drifts again.
//
// ⚠️ UPDATE 2026-08-08 — NEITHER DIRECTION IS SILENT ANY MORE, so this set is now a DIAGNOSTIC
// rather than a correctness dependency, and a stale one no longer corrupts a run:
//   * a phantom name  → the task is dispatched, returns null, and is reported as a DROPPED TASK
//     (named, escalated, `reason: 'task_dropped'`) instead of vanishing from the wave.
//   * an omitted real agent → under the default `hitl_routing: 'marker'` it is dispatched with a
//     warning, not reclassified as a human gate. Only opt-in `'roster'` mode reclassifies.
// Keeping it accurate is still worthwhile (it is what makes the pre-dispatch warning useful, and
// what `'roster'` mode depends on), but it is no longer load-bearing. Regenerate it per deployment
// against that deployment's own `.claude/agents/` when convenient — not urgently.
//
// ⚠️ THE SET BELOW IS PER-DEPLOYMENT — do not assume the value you are reading came from upstream.
// Some deployments have regenerated it against their own `.claude/agents/`; others still carry the
// upstream default, which lists `api-librarian`, `telemetry-auditor` and `frontend-developer` —
// names that exist in no known agents dir. The default keeps them rather than removing them
// because presence cannot be verified from upstream, and removing a name a given deployment DOES
// have would reclassify a dispatchable task as a human gate.
//
// Regenerate it from the deploying repo's own `.claude/agents/`. A sync from upstream does NOT
// clobber a regenerated set: `agentic_meta_dev/scripts/sync_project_workflows.py` treats this
// block as its one per-deployment exemption and carries the LOCAL value across the write. Two
// checkers exclude it from their diffs for the same reason (`check_global_artifact_drift.py`, and
// that script's `roster-only` verdict) — so a green gate is not evidence this list matches
// upstream. It is not supposed to. This note is deliberately deployment-neutral so that no repo
// needs a local variant of it; a repo-specific edit here re-opens the drift it warns about.
//
// `council-review` is deliberately EXCLUDED: it is a skill, not an agent, in every deployment.
// Its presence here was the mechanism of a real defect — a phase whose only security signal was
// gate_lens:['security'] dispatched it as an agentType, so the security lens never ran while the
// failure looked like a flaky reviewer. Keeping it in this set is what let that pass isHitlTask()
// instead of being caught. Never re-add it.

//
//   'marker' (DEFAULT) — `t.hitl === true` is the SOLE authority on whether a task is a human
//                        gate. An assigned_to the roster does not recognize is DISPATCHED, with
//                        a warning; if it resolves to nothing, the dropped-task check names it.
//   'roster'           — legacy behaviour: additionally reclassify any assigned_to outside
//                        KNOWN_AGENT_TYPES as a human gate.
//
// Why 'marker' is the default. The roster clause was inference layered on top of an explicit
// declaration, and it failed in the INVISIBLE direction: a real agent missing from the set was
// silently reclassified as a human gate, so a perfectly dispatchable task never ran (17 agents
// were omitted this way at once). Worse, the set cannot verify agent existence at all — workflow
// scripts have no filesystem access, so it is a hand-maintained mirror that must be regenerated
// per deployment and rots between regenerations. The phantom half is now caught AFTER dispatch
// by the dropped-task check below, which is where it is actually observable, and which also
// catches failures the set never could (an agent that exists but is unloadable, a stalled leg).
// That makes roster accuracy a DIAGNOSTIC rather than a correctness dependency.
//
// 'roster' is kept because the strictness is legitimately wanted where the roster is trustworthy
// — an enterprise deployment with a curated agent catalog may prefer an unrecognized name held
// for a human over dispatched. It is opt-in precisely because it is only safe when something
// actually keeps the set accurate. Tracker: node_01KZ9DBRAH35XHNH7NQA1H5NYT.

//
// `p.batches[][]` used to be consumed as if every member were a COMPLETE task object,
// while /dev:execute-plan's pre-flight instruction ("group tasks by files_affected
// disjointness") reads naturally as an INDEX over `p.tasks`. Nothing reconciled the two and
// nothing rejected the mismatch, so an id-only member — `batches: [[{id:'M1-01'}]]` — took
// the worst possible path: `t.prompt` was undefined, so the agent was dispatched with the
// literal string "undefined" plus the durability footer; `t.assigned_to` was undefined, so
// `agentType` was undefined; and `isHitlTask({id})` returned FALSE (no `hitl` flag, and the
// unknown-agent branch is guarded by `!!t.assigned_to`), so the malformed member was
// classified DISPATCHABLE rather than caught. The wave then "ran", the agents burned budget
// on a one-word prompt, and their output flowed into taskOut and on to the reviewer gate,
// which was asked to validate acceptance criteria against work that was never attempted.
// No error, no null, no escalation — the phase could plausibly come back approved.
//
// Two changes close it. resolveBatchMember() makes the documented id-reference form work as

// Two changes make the instruction survivable: (1) commits are pathspec-scoped and every

// occurrences in one program, 8 delegate-bug findings in 7 days. Second class, 5 findings:
// legs self-reporting side effects they never performed.

the path production takes. Before you treat any criterion as met on the strength of tests,
establish which ONE of these you actually saw, and name it in \`verification_path\`:
  - live-smoke ................. the real entry point run against the real dependency, output shown
  - path-equivalence ........... the seam the test drives IS the object production calls — name both
                                 call sites (file:line) and show they resolve to the same thing
  - real-endpoint-field-check ... every field/key name in a fake checked against a real response or
                                 schema (observed: a fake echoed \`system\` where the live API
                                 returns \`source_system\` — all tests green, feature could not work)
  - production-callsite-trace ... you traced production's entry point to the changed code and it is
                                 reachable (observed: a branch made dead by an earlier
                                 comment-stripping step, still covered by its own unit tests)
If none of the four holds, the criterion is NOT met and the suite is not evidence for it. Check the
dry-run/apply split too: a dry-run that validates a different precondition set than \`apply\` is the
same defect wearing a different hat. Set \`verification_path.established\` true ONLY for one of the
four kinds — withholding it costs nothing, and an approving verdict without it is recorded as a
gate-integrity failure rather than an approval.

SELF-REPORT RULE — never accept a leg's, a report's, or a summary's statement that a side effect
happened as evidence that it happened. "I registered the node / wrote the file / updated the row /
published the artifact" is a claim; the evidence is the artifact itself — the row, the file on
disk, the response body, the diff hunk. Verify each one yourself, or list it in
\`self_reported_claims\`, which blocks approval by construction.`

// one, edit the others in the same commit. `tests/test_workflow_gate_integrity.py` §

// see reviewer-gate.js:262-302 for the full grounding (skillmeat PR #299) and per-piece
// rationale (R7 measurement reconciliation, AC-3 red-test rejection, AC-2 baseline delta,
// measurement-integrity gate).

const VALIDATION_SCOPE_RULES = `TEST-SCOPE RULE — your scope for READING is the changed files above, but your scope for TEST
SELECTION is the resolved scope below, which is deliberately WIDER. It was computed by
symbol reference: every test file that names a symbol this diff changed, including files the
diff never touched. A test file can assert the exact behaviour a change removes without
appearing in the diff at all — that is the defect this gate exists to catch, and "the files I
edited" can never see it. Do not narrow the test scope back to the diff.

BASELINE-DELTA RULE — a red test file proves nothing on its own if it was ALREADY red. Judge
regressions by the measured per-file delta below (base counts vs head counts, and the set of
node ids failing at head that were not failing at base), never by the absolute red count. A
file that is 61-red at base and 61-red at head has told you nothing; a file that gained one
NEW failing node id has told you everything. Conversely: a test that stopped being collected
at head ran NOWHERE, so it cannot evidence anything, and its absence LOWERS the failure count —
if the measurement reports a collected-regression or a disappeared node id, treat it as a
regression, never as an improvement.

RED-TEST-AC RULE — never mark an acceptance criterion met on the strength of a test that is
failing, xfailing, erroring, skipped, or was never run. List each criterion's real support in
\`ac_verdicts[].supporting_tests\` as {nodeid, status}, using the measured status below rather
than your expectation of it. A criterion whose only support is red is NOT met: say so, with
the node ids and their statuses as the reason. Every status you report is cross-checked against
the measurement, and a claimed status the measurement contradicts is itself recorded as a
finding — so report what was measured, not what should have been true.

MEASUREMENT-INTEGRITY RULE — if the measurement below is absent, failed, or reports a
truncated scope, say so plainly and do NOT compensate by approving on the narrower evidence.
An unmeasurable scope makes affected criteria \`unverifiable\`, never met.`

// Statuses that cannot support a criterion. `xpassed` is deliberately ABSENT (it passed,
// however confusingly). `not-run` and `errored` are here because a test that did not run
// carries no information at all — the most common way this gate got fooled.

// Council verdict assessment (authoring-spec §8b, one level up).

// §8b closes the case where a reviewer DIES: verdict === null ⇒ gate_failure, gate_ran:false,
// escalate:true. It does not touch the case where a verdict EXISTS but is conditional,
// partial, or self-reportedly under-evidenced — and that case was collapsing into a clean
// pass. Observed 2026-08-04 at an M1 council gate: the council's own scorecard said
// recommendation "proceed_with_conditions", overall 45/100, every lens 2–3/10, evidence
// completeness 1/10, and its findings.yaml recorded that 5 of 8 adjudicated findings never
// reached the artifact writer. The orchestrator received `approved:true` with
// `required_fixes: []` and `arc_validate_passed:false`, and the wave advanced. Nothing in the
// envelope pointed at any of it; it was found only by opening the scorecard by hand.
//
// Three independent losses, all pointing the same way — toward false assurance:
//   1. 'proceed_with_conditions' → approved:true. The verdict is boolean, so "proceed, but
//      these conditions hold" is indistinguishable from an unconditional pass, and the
//      conditions are dropped rather than carried as required_fixes.
//   2. Findings lost between adjudication and the artifact writer are reported as if the
//      SURVIVORS were the whole population — the envelope actively asserts watchlist:0 for a
//      run that had 3 watchlist findings it simply never received.
//   3. arc_validate_passed:false is present, load-bearing, and keyed off by nothing.
//
// A lost-findings or failed-validation run is NOT a rejection: there is no finding to act on,
// so a fix cycle would edit blind and then re-review unchanged code. It belongs in the same
// family as gate_ran:false — re-dispatch or record an explicit operator override. A
// conditional verdict IS actionable, so its conditions become required_fixes and it takes the
// normal non-approval path.

  git diff "$MB"..HEAD
  git status --porcelain                  # work that exists but was never committed

EVIDENCE RULE: evidence is a \`file:line\` you read, a function/behaviour you traced, or a
command you ran and its output. A task id or a quoted task summary is NOT evidence — it is the
claim under review, and citing it validates the report against itself. If you cannot point at
code for an AC, it is NOT MET, even when a task says it did it.

Write your complete AC validation checklist to: ${artifactPath}

  - [x] AC text — MET: <file:line or traced behaviour> | PATH: <live-smoke | path-equivalence |
        real-endpoint-field-check | production-callsite-trace> — <what you saw>

Every MET line MUST carry a PATH segment naming one of the four kinds. A MET line whose evidence
is only "the tests pass" has no path and is NOT MET. End the file with one line:
  VERIFICATION-PATH: <kind> — <production entry point> — <evidence>
or, when you could not establish one for the phase as a whole:
  VERIFICATION-PATH: not-established — <why>
and a line listing anything you had to take on a task agent's word:
  SELF-REPORTED: <claim>; <claim>    (or "SELF-REPORTED: none")

This file MUST exist before you return. A downstream structurer will read it to emit the verdict.
Do NOT emit structured output yourself. Do NOT git add/commit/push/stash.`

  4. Set reviewer_type to "${reviewerType}".

     real-endpoint-field-check | production-callsite-trace; otherwise established=false with
