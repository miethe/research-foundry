/**
 * auto-feature — autopilot lane: request → plan → feasibility gate → execute
 *
 * Spec: .claude/specs/workflows/auto-feature-workflow-spec.md
 * Master contract: .claude/specs/workflows/workflow-authoring-spec.md
 * Recalibration: .claude/plans/tiered-workflow-overhaul.md §12 (Opus 4.8 + Autopilot)
 *
 * Takes a RAW feature request (not a pre-built plan), classifies it against the
 * recalibrated tier system, decomposes it into an ExecutionGraph, applies a
 * deterministic single-pass feasibility gate, and — when the work fits single-pass
 * capacity — executes it by NESTING the existing engines (execute-contract for a
 * single wave, execute-plan for ≤3 waves), which bring their own reviewer + fix-loop.
 * When the work exceeds single-pass capacity (or hits a Mode D / SPIKE boundary) it
 * returns needs_opus with a specific reason so Opus routes to full planning — always
 * leaving a durable plan artifact on disk so escalation gets a head start.
 *
 * Post-execution, a Phase 4 Verify gate runs an adversarial claims-vs-code pass over the finished
 * diff (only when the nested engine reported complete). "Green per-phase validators" is necessary
 * but not sufficient — two AARs caught a critical data bug + a refresh gap that survived green
 * per-phase gates. Confirmed critical/high findings downgrade complete → needs_opus/post_verify_failed.
 *
 * Patterns used: two-stage structuring (durability), modeBoundary (gate), sub-workflow
 *   nesting (one level only), adversarialVerify (Phase 4). Per-phase reviewer gating + fix-loops
 *   are delegated to the nested engines — NOT reimplemented here; Phase 4 is the whole-diff pass on top.
 *
 * Durability design (see workflow-authoring-spec.md §16):
 *   - Plan stage: implementation-planner, NO schema. Writes the plan artifact (with an
 *     embedded `autopilot-graph` JSON block) to disk before returning plain text.
 *   - Structure stage: haiku general-purpose agent, schema: AUTOPILOT_PLAN_SCHEMA.
 *     Reads the artifact and extracts the structured plan. try/catch → graceful fallback.
 *
 * Four-constraints checklist:
 *   [x] No FS/shell access in script body (planner writes the artifact; nested git merges = Opus)
 *   [x] Mode D triggers early return before the Execute phase / nested engine spawns
 *   [x] All reviewer agents use edit-less agentType (nested engines + Phase 4 senior-code-reviewer)
 *   [x] Phase 4 verify skeptics are read-only; they read the diff via git, never EnterWorktree
 *   [x] No Date.now() / Math.random() / new Date() in script body
 *   [x] meta is a pure literal object
 *   [x] phase() titles match meta.phases exactly
 *   [x] No while-loops here (fix-loops live in nested engines, already budget-guarded)
 *   [x] Planner prompt forbids git add/commit/push/stash; nested engines own commit discipline

  - Each child MUST use a read-only subagent_type ('codebase-explorer' or 'search-specialist').
  - Depth cap = 1: children MUST NOT spawn their own children.
  - Each child is bounded to fewer than 15 tool uses; keep scoping questions narrow.
  - Mode-D-at-depth: if a sub-area touches auth / payments / migrations / deletion / force-push /
    secret-rotation, do NOT delegate it — STOP and note 'needs_opus / mode_d' in the plan artifact.
  - Claude-primary-only; children write nothing to git. You remain the single author of the plan

You are the autopilot planner. Classify and decompose the following feature request, then write

=== FEATURE REQUEST ===
${parsed.request}
=== END REQUEST ===${requestIdSection}
Default category: ${category}
Timestamp (use verbatim; do not invent a date): ${parsed.timestamp}${contextSection}

STEPS:
1. Explore the codebase symbols-first (ai/symbols-*.json), then targeted reads, to ground scope.
2. Classify: tier (0-3), effort_points, and decompose into an ExecutionGraph of sequential WAVES
   (each wave = a set of phases that can run in parallel; phases contain tasks with disjoint file
   ownership). Count: wave_count (sequential depth), phase_count (total), file_count (distinct
   files_affected across all tasks).
3. Choose execution_target:
   - 'execute-contract' when the work is ONE cohesive sprint (single wave, ≤8 pts, no meaningful
     phase decomposition). Write a Feature Contract.
   - 'execute-plan' when the work needs 2-3 sequential waves. Write a lightweight Implementation
     Plan with wave_plan-style structure.
4. Detect boundaries HONESTLY (the gate trusts these):
   - mode_d = true if the work touches auth, payments, billing, DB migrations, data deletion,
     secret/token rotation, or infrastructure. List mode_d_reasons.
   - needs_spike = true if there are unresolved research/feasibility unknowns that must be
     investigated before committing to an approach. List spike_reasons.
   - single_pass_feasible = your assessment vs. the ceiling (max_points ${ceiling.max_points},
     max_waves ${ceiling.max_waves}, max_phases ${ceiling.max_phases}, max_files ${ceiling.max_files}).
     This is ADVISORY — a deterministic gate re-checks it.
5. Build each task's prompt fully: first line a Mode marker, then file paths and acceptance
   detail, ending with "Do NOT git add/commit/push/stash." Assign each task an appropriate
   implementation agentType (python-backend-engineer, ui-engineer-enhanced, data-layer-expert,
   refactoring-expert, etc.). Set per-phase review_intensity ('standard' default; 'tier3' for
   core-path/risky phases; 'council' only if cross-domain architecture review is warranted).
6. WRITE the artifact:
   - Feature Contract → docs/project_plans/feature_contracts/${category}/<slug>.md
   - Implementation Plan → docs/project_plans/implementation_plans/${category}/<slug>-v1.md
   Use the canonical frontmatter + body for that doc_type (see .claude/skills/planning templates).
   Derive <slug> as a short kebab-case name from the request.
7. EMBED a fenced \`\`\`json block tagged exactly "autopilot-graph" near the top of the artifact
   body, containing this object (the downstream structurer parses ONLY this block):
   {
     "tier": <int 0-3>, "effort_points": <number>,
     "wave_count": <int>, "phase_count": <int>, "file_count": <int>,
     "mode_d": <bool>, "mode_d_reasons": [<string>...],
     "needs_spike": <bool>, "spike_reasons": [<string>...],
     "single_pass_feasible": <bool>,
     "plan_artifact_path": "<the exact repo-relative path you wrote>",
     "execution_target": "execute-contract" | "execute-plan",
     "slug": "<kebab-slug>", "category": "${category}",
     "review_intensity": "standard" | "tier3" | "council",
     "files_affected": [<string>...],
     "execution_graph": { "waves": [ { "id": "wave-1", "phases": [ { "id": "phase-1", "title": "...", "mode": "C", "review_intensity": "standard", "tasks": [ { "id": "TASK-1.1", "prompt": "<full agent prompt>", "assigned_to": "<agentType>", "effort": <number>, "files_affected": [<string>...] } ] } ] } ] },
     "escalation_recommendation": "<one line: if this exceeds single-pass capacity, what full-planning path to take>"
   }
   For execute-contract, execution_graph may be a single wave/phase whose task is the sprint;
   the contract file itself is the source of truth for the sprint.

The autopilot planner just wrote a plan artifact under docs/project_plans/ (a Feature Contract
or an Implementation Plan). Its body contains a fenced \`\`\`json block tagged "autopilot-graph".

Here is the planner's own report, verbatim. It names the exact artifact path it wrote. This is
AUTHORITATIVE — the path you return MUST be the one named here:

STEPS:
1. Take the artifact path from the planner report above. Do NOT search for it, and do NOT fall
   back to "most recently modified file" — a stale artifact from an earlier, unrelated feature
   is the single failure this stage has actually produced in practice, twice. If the report
   somehow names no path, return single_pass_feasible=false and say so in
   escalation_recommendation rather than guessing.
2. Read THAT artifact and find the fenced "autopilot-graph" JSON block.
3. Return that object EXACTLY as the structured AutopilotPlan, conforming to the schema. Pass
   execution_graph through verbatim. Do not invent or alter values; copy what the planner wrote.
   In particular tier / effort_points / execution_graph must match the artifact — the caller's
   feasibility gate depends on them, so understating tier silently disables it.
4. If you cannot find the artifact or the block, return your best-effort object with
   single_pass_feasible=false and escalation_recommendation explaining the miss.

An autopilot run just reported its nested engine COMPLETE with all per-phase validators green. That
is necessary but NOT sufficient: per-phase checklist validators have repeatedly rationalized real
defects (data-corruption and state-refresh bugs) that only a whole-diff, code-tracing pass catches.
You are that pass. Be adversarial: assume the "green" result is hiding a defect until you prove otherwise.

STEPS:
1. Get the finished work via git IN THE CURRENT WORKING TREE (do NOT call EnterWorktree — this tree
   is already the run's tree, so switching would move you AWAY from the diff under review):
${baseBlock}
2. Read the plan/contract artifact at: ${artifact}
   Extract every concrete CLAIM / acceptance criterion it makes about behavior.
3. Trace each claim to the actual diff. For each, decide: does the code REALLY do what is claimed?
   Prioritize these two recurring failure classes (the ones prior AARs caught):
     (a) DATA-INTEGRITY / STATE-MUTATION bugs — e.g. a revert/undo/cascade that overwrites or wipes
         unrelated rows/fields; a write that clobbers concurrent state; an off-by-one on a batch.
     (b) REFRESH / REFLECTION gaps — the mutation succeeds but the UI, cache, query, or derived state
         is NOT refreshed/invalidated, so the change is invisible or stale to the next read.
   Also flag: claims with no supporting code, error/empty paths left unhandled, and swallowed failures.
4. Return VERIFY_FINDINGS_SCHEMA:
     - verified: true ONLY if you traced the claims and found no critical/high defect.
     - findings: one entry per real defect. Set severity honestly (critical = data loss / correctness
       break / security; high = a claimed behavior is broken or a refresh gap makes it non-functional;
       medium/low = smells worth noting). Include claim, code_location (file:line), and mismatch.
   Do NOT invent findings to look thorough; an empty findings array with verified:true is the right
   answer for a genuinely clean diff.
