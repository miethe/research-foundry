# Plan Doctrine (Claude-5 generation)

## Why this exists

Plans were tuned for 2025-era models: enumerate every task, pin an agent and a model to each,
lock phase boundaries, gate every hop. Measured against six real plans, that structure *caused*
cost rather than controlling it — the most expensive effort carried 35 plan-time agent pins and
35 model pins; the cheapest comparable carried none. Frontier models degrade under prescription
density. Plan for a capable executor, not a task queue.

## The four authoring rules

**1. Spec the destination, not the route.** A plan carries intent, acceptance criteria, rubrics,
named risks, decisions-to-surface, and references (code > mockups > prose). Enumerate tasks
*only* where sequencing is load-bearing — migrations, serialization barriers, cross-repo
handshakes — and say so explicitly at the point of enumeration. If you cannot name why the order
matters, do not order it.

**2. Milestones, not phases.** Three to four coarse milestones with AC replace six to ten
sequential phases. A milestone is **a reviewable state of the system**, not a batch of tasks.
Hand an executor a whole milestone; it starts at the top of its difficulty range.

> **Terminology.** This is a *fourth* sense of "milestone" in the stack. It is not the
> `milestone:` frontmatter release marker, not the IntentTree `node_type: milestone`, and not
> "a batch boundary inside a phase" (dev-execution's older usage). When ambiguity is possible,
> write **plan milestone**.

**3. No plan-time model or agent pins.** Plans carry *constraints*, not identities: which classes
must stay claude-primary, what is offload-eligible, and the capability bar per milestone. The
orchestrator resolves provider and model at dispatch time via `delegation-router` against the
live registry. Plans that pinned models were obsolete within days of authoring.

> A plan MAY pin where the constraint is contractual ("never offload merge-path correctness") —
> phrased as a constraint, never as a model id.

**4. Plan mass is a budget.** Target **<=150 lines** for a Tier 3 plan, frontmatter included.
Decisions live in the plan (one file), not spread across sibling worknotes every leg must
re-read. AC prose appears once — the PRD owns narrative AC; the plan owns the AC -> command ->
evidence matrix. Cross-repo plans carry a <=30-line inlined context digest instead of a stack of
required-reading refs.

## Context class

Points size human-scale scope; they do not size agent context. Each milestone additionally
declares a **context class**, which is what actually predicts burn.

| class | shape | expected burn | execution posture |
|---|---|---|---|
| **C1** | bounded, single-module | <=50M | economy/workhorse model, single session |
| **C2** | cross-module, one repo | <=200M | workhorse, 1-2 sessions, notes-forward |
| **C3** | cross-repo or migration | <=600M | frontier orchestrator, decomposed contexts, gate budget 2 |
| **C4** | cross-repo + adversarially gated + novel | explicit budget required | frontier + fresh-context verifiers; operator checkpoint at every milestone boundary |

Weigh six drivers when assigning: write-risk surfaces, shared hot files and serialization
barriers, validation fan-out scope, unresolved design uncertainty, expected context footprint per
dispatch, and expected retry probability. The working model is
**expected dispatches x bounded context packet x review/retry rounds** — which is why gate
budgets and delta-context dispatch are the levers that move it, not tighter estimates.

Context class generalizes H7 (`estimation-heuristics.md`): a task touching a >2K-line file costs
>=2x its points because of *context*, not behavior. Realized-vs-declared burn is reviewed weekly
from the CCDash token rollup; two consecutive misses on a class recalibrates **the class table**,
not the individual estimate. Points were non-predictive in the retro — an 18M-138M spread per
point across six plans with near-equal per-task estimates.

## Model-conditional expansion

The doctrine is itself model-conditional. Economy-class executors may still need an expanded task
list — but it is **generated at dispatch time by the orchestrator from the milestone AC**, never
stored in the plan. The plan stays thin; expansion is a render.

## What does not change

Worktree -> PR -> squash protocol, IntentTree binding, DoD and SkillMeat registration, changelog
discipline. None of these were burn drivers; they are cheap, high-value bookkeeping. Keep them.

## Failure mode this doctrine accepts

Under-specification on genuinely novel work. Mitigated by surfacing *unknowns* during planning
(blind-spot pass + interview step, which replace the effort previously spent enumerating tasks)
and by C4's explicit operator checkpoints. If a plan cannot name its unknowns, it is not thin —
it is vague, and thinning it further is the wrong move.
