# Completion Criteria

Definition of done for stories, features, and tasks.

## Mandatory Reviewer Gates

Tiered features require reviewer-agent gates at specific checkpoints. Phases and sprints are **not complete** without the reviewer pass listed below.

| Tier | Gate | Reviewer | Inputs |
|------|------|----------|--------|
| 1 | end of sprint | `task-completion-validator` | contract + diff + Completion Report |
| 2 | end of each phase | `task-completion-validator` | failure summary (on a re-pass) + touched files + AC in question |
| 2 | end of feature | `karen` | AC matrix + cumulative diff |
| 3 | end of each phase | `task-completion-validator` | failure summary (on a re-pass) + touched files + AC in question |
| 3 | mid-feature milestones | `karen` | AC matrix + cumulative diff |
| 3 | end of feature | `karen` | AC matrix + cumulative diff |

**Invariant**: This is non-optional. A phase/sprint cannot be marked complete until the reviewer at the listed checkpoint has approved.

**Delta context, not the full stack** (execution-doctrine.md rule 2). Per-phase `task-completion-validator`
gates carry the delta — the failure summary, the touched files, and the AC actually in question — never
the full plan, the cumulative diff, or the progress file. `karen`'s whole-tree reality-check is the one
legitimate exception: it keeps the cumulative diff, but trades "full plan" for the AC matrix so the
packet stays bounded to what's actually being judged. A reviewer that needs the whole plan to judge one
AC is a signal the AC is under-specified — fix the AC, do not widen the packet.

**Gate budget** (execution-doctrine.md rule 1): max **2 re-passes** per scope × lens. The 3rd failure
against the same scope × lens does not escalate to "a human/Opus looks at it" — it **auto-escalates to
re-scope/redesign**. Re-passes count per scope × lens, not per dispatch: re-spawning the executor does
not reset the budget. This is a hard cap, not an expectation — see `references/gate-risk-classes.md`
§4 for the cost calibration it bounds.

**Tier 1's Completion Report is a different artifact from the retired plan-level one.** The Tier 1 row
above still carries a Completion Report because Tier 1 has no wave/phase record to fall back on — see
the "### Completion Report" section under Tier 1 Sprint Completion below, and `dev-execution/SKILL.md`'s
Exit Criteria note. The Tier 2/3 **plan-level** Completion Report (`.claude/worknotes/<slug>/completion-report.md`)
is **retired**: the reviewer verdict + `commit_refs` is the record for those tiers (execution-doctrine.md,
Bookkeeping demotions).

See `.claude/rules/delegation-modes.md` (Mode E: Reviewer) for reviewer agent specifications and constraints.

### Rich Feature Report Definition-of-Done

At the **end-of-feature** gate, apply the `delivery-report` (route `feature`) eligibility policy.
Dev-execution Tier 2/3 features require a validated rich report; Tier 1 features at 5+ points or with
visible, cross-component, security, migration, high-risk, or material-finding signals are recommended.
An explicit user request always makes the report required. Phase-only gates do not emit duplicate
reports when the parent feature report covers them.

The reviewer runs:

```bash
DELIVERY_REPORT_TIER_SYSTEM="dev-execution" DELIVERY_REPORT_TIER="${FEATURE_TIER:-0}" \
DELIVERY_REPORT_POINTS="${FEATURE_POINTS:-0}" DELIVERY_REPORT_SIGNALS="${FEATURE_SIGNALS:-}" \
DELIVERY_REPORT_MANIFEST="${DELIVERY_REPORT_MANIFEST:-}" DELIVERY_REPORT_HTML="${DELIVERY_REPORT_HTML:-}" \
DELIVERY_REPORT_ASSET_ROOT="${DELIVERY_REPORT_ASSET_ROOT:-.}" \
    .claude/skills/dev-execution/hooks/verify-delivery-report.sh
```

| Result | Gate |
|---|---|
| Required + manifest/HTML present and `delivery-report validate` passes | PASS |
| Required + missing or invalid report | **FAIL — withhold APPROVED** |
| Recommended/optional + no report | PASS with recommendation/status recorded |
| Required + explicit `DELIVERY_REPORT_WAIVER_REASON` | WARN/pass; reviewer must quote the waiver in the final report |

The report is derived evidence, not the completion authority. It must preserve exact git, test,
review, deployment, and owner-held/private-execution truth. Place it in the repository's native
completion-artifact directory, or `.claude/reports/<feature-slug>/` when no convention exists.

### Forward Status Reports (recommended, non-blocking)

The `feature` route above is the only **required** report gate. Its three forward-looking siblings —
`delivery-report` routes `program` (end of a plan/epic), `phase` (end of a wave/phase), and
`readiness` (a go/no-go decision) — are **recommended, never blocking**. They are point-in-time
snapshots of work in flight, not completion authority, so:

- A reviewer **never** withholds `APPROVED` because a forward report is absent. There is no
  `verify-*.sh` gate for them by design.
- Produce one when a shareable, evidence-backed status artifact is wanted (a milestone, a stakeholder
  ask, a go/no-go). Skip for a quick conversational status.
- The lifecycle → route map and the command touch-points live in `dev-execution/SKILL.md`
  § "Forward-Looking Status Reports", the two `/dev:execute-*` commands, `/plan:explore` (readiness),
  and the planning skill's "Status & Readiness Reporting" section.

Record a produced forward report's HTML path in the closeout / tracker like any other artifact; do not
add a DoD row for it.

### AOS Writeback Definition-of-Done (gate, not prose — audit P3.9)

A phase is **not done** until its work has landed back in the Agentic OS. This is a **reviewer gate**,
not a remembered step: the reviewer MUST run the writeback check and withhold `APPROVED` on a FAIL.

The reviewer runs, with the bound node/tree resolved per `.claude/rules/intenttree-integration.md`:

```bash
ITT_NODE_ID="${ITT_NODE_ID:-}" INTENTTREE_TREE="${INTENTTREE_TREE:-}" \
    .claude/skills/dev-execution/hooks/verify-writeback.sh   # exit 1 ⇒ withhold APPROVED
```

The reviewer additionally runs, for any phase that built/updated a skill/agent/command/context
artifact, the sibling **SkillMeat save-after** gate (aos-native-by-default P3; D2/D6 — the
executor's look-first instruction is instruct-only per `dev-execution/SKILL.md`'s executor
contract, this is the enforced check):

```bash
PHASE_FILES="${PHASE_FILES:-}" SKILLMEAT_PROJECT="${SKILLMEAT_PROJECT:-}" \
    .claude/skills/dev-execution/hooks/verify-skillmeat-writeback.sh   # exit 1 ⇒ withhold APPROVED
# or: --files-from <progress-or-plan-file>  (reads tasks[].files_affected / files_affected:)
```

| Signal | How verified | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| Bound IntentTree node is `completed` | `verify-writeback.sh` (`itt node get` status) | **HARD** — FAIL (exit 1) blocks APPROVED when a binding exists |
| New AI artifact is checked-for-reuse + saved/updated in SkillMeat enterprise | `verify-skillmeat-writeback.sh` (`skillmeat show` against the enterprise instance) | **HARD** — FAIL (exit 1) blocks APPROVED when a new artifact path is present, `SKILLMEAT_PROJECT` resolves, and the endpoint is reachable |
| AAR / story captured | reviewer confirms the Stop-event writeback hook ran (or `op story scan` shows the entry) | reviewer-confirmed |
| Decisions ingested to the vault | reviewer confirms `meatywiki` ingest (Stop hook) for any decisions the phase made | reviewer-confirmed |

**No-binding escape hatch:** in a repo with no AOS binding (`ITT_NODE_ID`/`INTENTTREE_TREE` unset), the
IntentTree gate is **N/A and passes** — it never blocks a non-AOS project. When `itt` is unreachable
the gate cannot verify and does not block, but the reviewer records writeback as *unverified*.
Likewise, the SkillMeat gate is **N/A and passes** when the phase built no new AI artifact, and
**WARN (unverified, non-blocking)** when the `skillmeat` CLI is missing, `SKILLMEAT_PROJECT` cannot
be resolved, or the enterprise endpoint is unreachable — it never blocks on infra unavailability,
only on a confirmed missing registration.

### Ephemeral Artifact Teardown Definition-of-Done

A plan/feature is **not done** until any artifact it provisioned only for its own duration has been
undeployed — the teardown half of Pre-Execution Artifact Provisioning
(`dev-execution/SKILL.md`'s "Pre-Execution Artifact Provisioning" section). This is a **reviewer
gate**, same posture as the AOS Writeback DoD above: the reviewer runs the provisioning gate in
teardown mode and withholds `APPROVED` on a FAIL.

```bash
PROVISION_TEARDOWN=1 PROVISION_SCOPE="plan:<slug>" \
    .claude/skills/dev-execution/hooks/provision-artifacts.sh   # nonzero (non-2) ⇒ withhold APPROVED
```

| Signal | How verified | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| Plan-scoped `lifecycle: ephemeral` artifacts in `.claude/aos-artifacts.yaml` are undeployed | `provision-artifacts.sh --teardown` (`skillmeat undeploy` against the scope) | **HARD** — FAIL blocks APPROVED when the manifest lists a plan-scoped ephemeral still `status: active` after teardown |
| Artifacts also referenced elsewhere as `permanent`, or with a different/wider `scope`, are left deployed | reviewer confirms via the manifest diff (teardown run is scope-filtered, not a blanket undeploy) | reviewer-confirmed |

**No-manifest escape hatch:** in a repo/plan with no manifest and no ephemeral entries, this gate is
**N/A and passes** — nothing was provisioned, so there is nothing to tear down. When SkillMeat is
unreachable the gate cannot verify and does not block; the reviewer records teardown as *unverified*.

## Reviewer Output Template

Reviewer agents must produce a structured report using this template:

```markdown
# Review Report: [Feature/Branch Name]

## Recommendation
[Approve / Approve with minor fixes / Request changes / Block]

## Confidence
[High / Medium / Low] — Brief rationale for confidence level

## Summary
[Concise assessment of overall implementation quality and adherence.]

## Contract Adherence
- Status: [Pass / Partial / Fail]
- Notes: [Details on which acceptance criteria passed/failed, scope drift if any]

## Required Fixes
1. [Blocking issue and fix needed]
2. [Additional blocking issues]

## High-Risk Concerns
- [High-risk issue that may be non-blocking but requires attention]
- ["None identified." if applicable]

## Test/Validation Assessment
- Tests claimed: [List tests agent reported running]
- Tests verified: [Tests confirmed to exist and be relevant]
- Missing tests: [Gaps in coverage, edge cases without tests]

## Architecture / Maintainability Notes
- [Pattern conformance or drift]
- [Code quality observations]

## Scope Drift
- [None / Details of what was added/removed vs. contract]

## Documentation Updates Needed
- [README, CHANGELOG, context files, ADRs, or "None"]

## AOS Writeback DoD (P3.9)
- [verify-writeback.sh (IntentTree): PASS / FAIL / N-A (no binding) / UNVERIFIED (itt offline)]
- [node completed? AAR/story captured? decisions ingested? — a FAIL blocks APPROVE]
- [verify-skillmeat-writeback.sh (SkillMeat): PASS / FAIL / N-A (no new artifact) / UNVERIFIED (CLI missing, project unresolved, or enterprise unreachable) — a FAIL blocks APPROVE]

## Ephemeral Artifact Teardown DoD
- [provision-artifacts.sh --teardown: PASS / FAIL / N-A (no manifest / no ephemerals) / UNVERIFIED (SkillMeat unreachable) — a FAIL blocks APPROVE]

## Rich Feature Report DoD
- [verify-delivery-report.sh: PASS / FAIL / RECOMMENDED / WAIVED — a required missing/invalid report blocks APPROVE]
- [manifest path, HTML path, eligibility tier/size, and any exact waiver reason]

## Final Decision
[One-line merge recommendation: "APPROVE" / "REQUEST CHANGES" / "BLOCK — <reason>"]
```

## Test-Rigor Acceptance Criteria (conditional)

These ACs are **mandatory** when the trigger applies; a phase/sprint is not complete without them.

**R1 — Real-session test (transaction/session/dedup tasks).** Any task touching DB transactions, sessions, savepoints, rollback, or dedup MUST ship ≥1 test against a **real session** (in-memory SQLite suffices for savepoint/rollback semantics), not only `MagicMock(spec=Session)`. Mocks have no transaction state and silently pass on `rollback()`-vs-`begin_nested()` bugs. *(Retro P1: a full-`rollback()` savepoint bug passed all mock tests; caught only by a real-SQLite savepoint test.)*

**R2 — Production-path presence (wiring/dual-surface tasks).** Any task whose AC is "feature X is reachable from surface Y" MUST ship a test that renders/exercises through the **real production entry point** (the actual parent component or call site) and asserts the feature is **present** — not only a component-in-isolation test. Validators MUST trace from the real entry point, not the leaf unit. **A test asserting the feature is *absent* is a smell**, not a passing case. *(Retro P4: an extract button was invisible in production because parents never threaded `parentArtifactId`; 64 isolated tests passed, one even asserted the broken behavior as correct.)*

## Story Completion

A user story is complete when:

### Implementation

- [ ] Integration tests for API flows
- [ ] E2E tests for critical user paths
- [ ] Negative test cases included
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] **Mutation flows verified against the datastore (Postgres/API read), not the DOM** — optimistic caches and stale renders lie; assert the row/response (CC v3.1 doctrine; see `visual-fidelity.md` R14)

### Quality

- [ ] TypeScript strict mode, no `any`
- [ ] Lint errors resolved
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] No regressions introduced

### Documentation

- [ ] API docs updated if endpoints added
- [ ] Code comments where logic isn't self-evident
- [ ] README updated if applicable

### Review

- [ ] Code reviewed by senior-code-reviewer
- [ ] Feedback addressed

### Tracking

- [ ] PR created and linked to story
- [ ] Progress tracker shows "complete"
- [ ] Request-log item marked done (if applicable)

## Feature Completion (Quick Feature)

A quick feature is complete when:

### Implementation

- [ ] Feature works as described
- [ ] Follows existing patterns
- [ ] No breaking changes

### Quality Gates

- [ ] `pnpm test` passes
- [ ] `pnpm typecheck` passes
- [ ] `pnpm lint` passes
- [ ] `pnpm build` succeeds

### Tracking

- [ ] Quick plan updated to `status: completed`
- [ ] Request-log item marked done (if from REQ-ID)
- [ ] Issues captured if discovered

## Task Completion

An individual task is complete when:

### Core Criteria

- [ ] Task description fulfilled
- [ ] Success criteria from plan met
- [ ] Files modified as expected

### Code Quality

- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] Lint clean

- [ ] Telemetry/logging added where appropriate

### Commit

- [ ] Changes committed with descriptive message
- [ ] References task ID in commit
- [ ] **`git status` clean against the expected file set before pausing/handing off** — in CC v3.1 a single file missed its phase commit and sat dirty for a session; reconcile the working tree against intended changes at every pause

## Tier 1 Sprint Completion

A Tier 1 feature sprint is complete when:

### Implementation

- [ ] Feature Contract authored and approved
- [ ] All Acceptance Criteria from the contract are satisfied (verified)
- [ ] All Validation Requirements from the contract are satisfied

### Testing & Validation

- [ ] No regressions introduced

### Documentation

- [ ] API docs updated if endpoints added
- [ ] Code comments where logic isn't self-evident
- [ ] README updated if applicable
- [ ] CHANGELOG entries added (if required by Feature Contract)

### Completion Report

> This is the Tier 1 **contract-appended** Completion Report — it survives (execution-doctrine.md,
> Bookkeeping demotions; `dev-execution/SKILL.md` Exit Criteria note). It is a different artifact from
> the Tier 2/3 **plan-level** Completion Report (`.claude/worknotes/<slug>/completion-report.md`), which
> is **retired**: for those tiers the reviewer verdict + `commit_refs` is the record instead.

- [ ] Completion Report appended to Feature Contract with:
  - Files changed
  - Tests run and results
  - Validation results
  - Deviations from contract (if any) — sourced from `.claude/worknotes/<slug>/implementation-notes.md`:
    per execution-doctrine.md's "Implementation notes over halt-and-gate", deviations (a conservative
    choice, an assumption, a discovered constraint) are logged there continuously with rationale and
    reviewed at the milestone boundary; this bullet is the summarized record of the survivors at
    contract close, not a re-derivation from scratch
  - Risks/limitations
  - Follow-up recommendations

### Review & Merge

- [ ] `task-completion-validator` review completed and approved (mandatory gate)
- [ ] Review Report confirms all acceptance criteria passed
- [ ] Opus commits changes

---

## Phase Completion

See [./milestone-checks.md] for full phase completion criteria.

Summary:
- [ ] All tasks completed
- [ ] All success criteria met
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Quality gates passed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Progress tracker at 100%
- [ ] All commits pushed
- [ ] **Reviewer pass complete per the Mandatory Reviewer Gates matrix above** (Tier 2/3: `task-completion-validator` per phase; `karen` at feature end; Tier 1: already covered above)
- [ ] **End-of-feature rich report gate passed** when the feature meets `delivery-report` (route `feature`) tier/size eligibility; phase-only closeout does not duplicate the parent report

## Validation Templates

### Task Validation

```
@task-completion-validator

Task: {task_id}

Expected outcomes:
- {outcome 1}
- {outcome 2}

Files changed:
- {file list}

Validate:
1. Acceptance criteria met
2. Architecture patterns followed
3. Tests exist and pass
4. No regression
```

### Story Validation

```
@task-completion-validator

Story: ${story_id}

Acceptance criteria from story:
- {criterion 1}
- {criterion 2}

Implementation summary:
- Backend: {what was done}
- Frontend: {what was done}
- Tests: {coverage}

Validate complete implementation.
```

### Phase Validation

```
@task-completion-validator

Phase ${phase_num} FINAL VALIDATION

Failure summary (if this is a re-pass): ${failure_summary}
Touched files: ${touched_files}
AC in question: ${ac_in_question}

Validate:
1. All tasks complete
2. Success criteria met
3. Tests passing
4. No critical issues
5. Ready for next phase
```

Delta context per execution-doctrine.md rule 2 — never `Plan: ${plan_path}` or `Progress: ${progress_file}`
in full. A reviewer that needs the whole plan/progress file to validate one phase is a signal the phase's
ACs are under-specified; fix the ACs, do not widen the packet.

## Common Completion Blockers

### What Blocks Completion

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Tests failing | Fix before marking complete |
| Type errors | Resolve all TypeScript issues |
| Missing acceptance criteria | Implement missing functionality |
| Unresolved comments | Address all review feedback |
| Breaking changes | Add migration or compatibility |

### When to NOT Mark Complete

Never mark complete if:
- Tests are failing for your changes
- Implementation is partial
- You encountered unresolved errors
- Required files/deps not found
- Review feedback not addressed

### When Blocked

If truly blocked:

1. Document blocker clearly
2. Keep status as `in_progress` or `blocked`
3. Create tracking issue
4. Report to user with:
   - What's blocking
   - What was attempted
   - What's needed to unblock
